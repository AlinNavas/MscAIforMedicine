1. Music Genre Classification using Transfer Learning on Spectogram
    
This project attempts to classify different 30-second audio clips into 10 music
genre classes. We first use several preprocessing steps like s like Mel Spectrogram, Mel
Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, STFT (Short Time Fourier Transforms), Spectrogram to convert the audio files
into images and then attempt to perform the classification task initially using a
baseline CNN model and then using pre-trained models to gauge any performance
improvement with significant hyperparameter tuning using baysean optimisation.
